# SeaShell - Beta Shell in C
=====================================
### Overview
SeaShell is a beta shell written in C. It is designed to be a simple and efficient command-line interface for interacting with the operating system. Right now I need help stablizing this latest version. I am looking for a C programmer to help me identify and fix any bugs that may be present in the SeaShell shell.
