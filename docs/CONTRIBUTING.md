## ðŸš¨ Help Wanted: Build Errors

Right now, SeaShell has **build issues** that I havenâ€™t been able to fix on my own. These errors are related to **unknown files**, missing dependencies, or compiler errors that I havenâ€™t tracked down yet.

If you're experienced with:
- C/C++ build systems
- Debugging `gcc` or `make` errors
- Resolving missing includes or link errors

**I would really appreciate your help**.

## How You Can Help

- Clone the repo and try running:
  ```sh
  make
```
> If there are any errors please fix them to the best of your ability and submit a pull request.
